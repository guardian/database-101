# Database 101

An introductory database course, focusing on Postgres.

* [Lesson 1 - adding data and basic queries](/lessons/lesson-1.html)
* [Lesson 2 - more queries](/lessons/lesson-2.html)

Examples have been liberally borrowed from the Postgres docs and other
usable sources.

## Requirements

* being a noob
* Postgres running locally ([Postgres App](https://postgresapp.com/)
  is recommended for Macs)

Once Postgres is running, you can use `psql` at the command line to
gain access.

`psql` help is available using:

    \h // for SQL commands, e.g. \h SELECT
    \? // for Postgres management help, e.g. \d+ products
